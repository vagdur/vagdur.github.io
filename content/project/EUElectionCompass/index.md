For the 2024 European Parliament elections, SVT, the Swedish public broadcasting corporation, [did a survey](https://valkompass.svt.se/eu-2024/) of all candidates from the established parties on a range of questions that were on the political agenda in that election. Based on this, they constructed a simple quiz to see which candidates most aligned with your own opinions.

Unfortunately, they provided no filtering by specific issues -- so for example, if one is absolutely unwilling to vote for any candidate opposed to support for Ukraine, it will still recommend candidates with the wrong stance on that issue if they align completely with you on other issues -- and no visualisations or interpretations of the overall data.

Thus, I decided to gather all their data from their page, and [create such a visualisation](https://rpubs.com/vagdur/EUval2024). The axes of the plot are the two first principal components of the data, which match very well with an intuitive understanding of the stances of the various political parties of Sweden, thus the labels assigned to them.
