As a part of their focus on knowledge-based policy and data-driven development of youth work, [KEKS](https://www.keks.se/in-english) performs an annual survey of participants, and continuous documentation using The Logbook. This, of course, creates a great deal of data enabling statistically-grounded answers to many questions.

In their daily operations, they have the tooling to answer simple questions about the mean responses to questions, but for more detailed analyses of subgroup responses or correlations between questions, they need external assistance, which I have provided over the last several years.

One particularly interesting analysis I did recently was of how demographic background variables, such as age and gender, affect outcome variables like perceived safety. Until now, this question had only been assessed by a simple pairwise comparison of the means -- so, for example, the mean perceived safety among visitors with parents born outside of Sweden is higher than in the other group -- but a regression analysis revealed that, controlling for age, gender, and having passing school grades, ethnicity is not a significant variable.

These analyses contributed to the forthcoming report "The Youth Centre: Myth and Reality", which will be available online in May 2025.
