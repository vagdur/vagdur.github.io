How _do_ support vector machines work, anyway? [This little page](https://v-agdur.shinyapps.io/WASP-AIML-Assignment2/) gives an interactive way to explore this question, by applying different kernels to a synthetic data set, along with some theory to explain what is going on.

This was originally an assignment in a course on machine learning, but I went above and beyond to provide this interactive visualisation instead of just writing a static report on it. The full code behind the project is available in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/vagdur/WASP-AIML-Assignment2).
