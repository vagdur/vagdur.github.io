This is a course I taught three times, in the spring semesters of 2023, 2024, and 2025. As the lecturer responsible for the course, I wrote an entirely new set of lecture notes for the course, and managed the entire project of teaching it, from planning assignments to giving lectures and designing examinations.

The full lecture notes and nearly all instructions given to students are available on the open course webpage linked below, and are released under a Creative Commons license. (The availability of the {{< math >}}$\LaTeX${{< /math >}} source was useful for visually impaired students, as well.)
