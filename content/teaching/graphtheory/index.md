This is a course I taught in the fall semester of 2023. I updated the lecture notes and content of the course, adding figures and explanations to what had been a very dry set of lecture notes. As with the combinatorics course, being lecturer also meant being in charge of designing examinations and managing all administrative matters regarding the course.

The full lecture notes are available on the open course webpage linked above, including nearly all information given to students, and one [report on the outcome of the exam](https://vagdur.github.io/Grafteori-1MA170/exam_report_jan24/exam_report.pdf) I wrote to make sense of which questions turned out to be hard or easy.
