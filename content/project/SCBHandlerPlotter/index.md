A little project to make it easier to explore some statistics provided by Statistics Sweden, the Swedish public statistics agency. It provides a handy syntax to grab data that does not require the user to remember which data is in which table, and a function for plotting this data on a map of the country.

[Here is one example of such a plot](https://rpubs.com/vagdur/ogifta), showing the number of unmarried women per unmarried man in the age span 19-33. The data reveals the expected trends -- the rate is highest in the university towns, while in the depopulating rural areas in the north, it is much lower.

This is probably my most "mature" project code-wise, in terms of having properly set up unit tests with good coverage, and generally adhering to good coding practices.
